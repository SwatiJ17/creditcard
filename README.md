# Credit Card Application

## Design

This project implements a credit card application which uses the multitier architecture.

In this client-server architecture, all of the information is distributed across multiple layers.
In a logical multilayer architecture with an object-oriented design, the following four are the most common:
 - Presentation layer (this is the UI or view layer)
 - Application layer (this is the service or controller layer)
 - Business layer (this is the layer where all of the client specific business logic sits)
 - Data access layer (this is the persistence layer, logging, networking, and other services which are required to support a particular business layer)

## Features

The application supports :
 1. Adding/creating new credit card in the system by taking name, card number, and limit(optional) from the user
    - Card numbers are validated using Luhn 10 Algorithm
    - New cards start with a Â£0 balance
    - For card numbers in-compatible with Luhn 10, error is returned.
     
 2. Displays all the existing credit cards in the system

         --header 'content-type: application/json'  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
         --data '{"creditCardNumber":"6374467634328732","name":"Monica Geller","creditLimit":1000}'

## Limitations and Scope for Improvements
   - This application is not in a production ready state. 
   - Basic tests have been designed with the intent to showcase the implementation of some useful functional and non-functional requirements. But surely there is room to add a comprehensive suite of tests.
   - Error messages can be improved.
